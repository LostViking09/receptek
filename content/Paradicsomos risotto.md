# Garlic Tomato "Risotto" Recipe (with Jamie Oliver's Tip)

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup raw rice (use whatever type you have)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil (use your garlic/tomato-infused olive oil)
- 1 onion, finely chopped (optional)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (if you want extra garlic flavor)
- 1 cup halved cherry tomatoes (your leftovers)
- 4 cups broth (vegetable, chicken, or whatever you have)
## Steps:
1. **Prepare Ingredients**: Gather all your ingredients.

2. **Saut√© Aromatics**: In a large pan, heat the garlic/tomato-infused olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion (if using) and garlic. Saut√© until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.

3. **Add Rice**: Stir in the raw rice and cook for 1-2 minutes, allowing it to absorb some oil and become slightly toasted.

4. **Start Adding Broth**: Add 1 cup of broth to the pan and stir. Cook, stirring frequently, until the broth is almost completely absorbed.

5. **Continue Adding Broth**: Add the remaining broth, 1 cup at a time, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next. This process should take about 15-20 minutes. If you run out of broth and the rice isn't fully cooked, you can add some water.

6. **Add Cherry Tomatoes**: In the last 5 minutes of cooking, add the halved cherry tomatoes and any leftover garlic/tomato-infused olive oil to the pan. Stir to combine and heat through.

7. **Season and Serve**: Add salt and pepper to taste. If you have any soft cheese, you can stir in a spoonful to make the dish creamier. Garnish with fresh herbs if you like.

8. **Jamie Oliver's Tip**: Remove the pan from the heat, add a knob of butter, and the Parmesan cheese (if you have it). Stir well. Place a lid on the pan and allow it to sit for 2 minutes. This step is crucial as it allows the risotto to become outrageously creamy and oozy.
