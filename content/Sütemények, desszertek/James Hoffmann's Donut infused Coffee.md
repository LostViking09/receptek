# Elkészítés
1. Start with 1 donut per 100ml of milk/mylk that you want to use. 
2. Chop each donut up and flatten slightly
3. Put the pieces into a saucepan and add your milk/mylk.
4. Cook on low heat until it reaches between 40 and 50 celsius.
5. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 20-30 minutes
6. Strain through a sieve, pressing out any liquid from the wet dough
7. Put in the fridge overnight
8. The next day take it out and strain again to remove any solidified oils.
9. Strain again if desired through muslin, or a tea towel or a fine mesh sieve.
10. Weigh the yield and add up to 5g of sugar per litre. I would start at 3g and taste and adjust.
11. Steam as you would with normal milk/mylk.
12. Add to espresso in a 1:1 to 1:2 ratio.
13. Enjoy!
